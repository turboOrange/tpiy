# tpiy
I'm creating a standard for password manager. It includes the API and the database structure.

## the name
I love horror so the name, TPIY stand's for the password in yellow that is a refferance to the king in yellow, a book by Robert W. Chambers.

## what is this repository.
This will contain the standards for TPIY password managers. I will build some versions of it while writing the standard. It will be mostly markdown and images.
